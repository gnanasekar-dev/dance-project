                Varnam is the most captivating and challenging piece in the
                Bharatanatyam Arangetram. It is the most extended and most
                demanding item the dancers will perform. This dance calls for
                perfect synchronization of Bhava, Raga, and Tala, thus giving
                the dancer abundant scope for displaying her rhythmic talents
                and rich and variegated abhinaya or expression. Here, the dancer
                uses her feet to match the rhythm of the jatis, move her hands
                according to the story, and portrays feeling and emotion through
                subtle yet effective facial expressions. The varnam, “Devar
                Munivar Thozhum Padam,” is a composition of the late violin
                Maestro Lalgudi G. Jayaraman in praise of Lord Venkateshwara,
                Lord of Thirupathi.
